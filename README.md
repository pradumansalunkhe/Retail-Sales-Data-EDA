# Retail-Sales-Data-EDA
In this project, you will work with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.
# Key Concepts and Challenges:



### Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
### Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
### Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
### Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
### Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
### Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.


# Learning Objectives:



### Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
### Develop skills in interpreting descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
### Learn to use data visualization for effective communication of insights.
